    <h1>Happy Valentine's</h1>
    <p> As you can probably tell by the way I'm delivering this "letter" I'm a computer science student here at ewu. Our eyes have met a couple of times and I hope you'll recall that once I tell you who I am.<br>
    I've noticed your beauty straight away but I honestly just couldn't bring myself to talk to you, so I figured out this would be the perfect time to reach out. After some digging I found out that you're an international athlete, which only made you more interesting.<br>
    I'm a sophomore and since I've been here at eastern I've never gotten caught up with someone this quickly and with such few interactions, although I've always had a soft spot for athletes.<br>
    So, you're probably still wondering who's the nerd who coded a whole QR code just cause he couldn't talk to you, aren't you?<br>
    Well, just click the button below.<br>
